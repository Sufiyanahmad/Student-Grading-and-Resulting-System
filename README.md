Student Grading and Resulting System
A C program for managing student grades and results with data persistence.
Description
This program allows users to add students, input grades for five subjects, calculate averages and grades (A-F), determine pass/fail status, and save/load data to/from grades.txt. A student passes if their average is â‰¥60 and no subject score is <40.
How to Use

Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc StudentGrading.c -o StudentGrading).
Run the executable (e.g., ./StudentGrading on Linux or StudentGrading.exe on Windows).
Choose options from the menu to:
Add a student (ID and name).
Add grades for a student (marks for five subjects).
View results for a specific student or all students.
Exit (saves data automatically).


Data is saved to grades.txt and loaded on startup.
